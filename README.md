# channel-spectrum-benchmarking
This is a python implementation of channel spectrum benchmarking (CSB) for some quantum gates, including single-qubit Pauli rotations, 2-qubit Fsim gates, 3-qubit
cycle implementing Toffoli gate and a 10-qubit cycle implementing an Ising Hamiltonian evolution operator. CSB is a scalable
protocol to estimate the individual noise properties of a universal quantum process from the noisy eigenvalues of its corresponding quantum channel. See the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02056
